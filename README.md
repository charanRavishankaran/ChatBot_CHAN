# CHAN
A chatbot built from NLP Project

Chatbot - PROJECT CHAN v1.0 
Introduction
CHAN is simple chat bot application that is used for general chatting between a user and a machine.
What is chatbot?
A chatbot is an artificial intelligence-powered piece of software application, website or other networks that try to gauge consumer’s needs and then assist them to perform a particular task.
Process
This simple chatbot application will interact with the user as a friend and chat with the user. It can answer simple queries asked by the user. This application is built in python and python library NLTK, scikit learn. This chatbot uses the concepts of NLP (NLP is a way for computers to analyse, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way)
Using NLTK packages we will do the text pre-processing and normalization of the data i.e. the process of tokenization, Stemming and lemmatization.
Bag of words: After the initial pre-processing phase, we need to transform the text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. The bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document
TF-IDF Approach: rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents. It is a transformation applied to texts to get two real-valued vectors in vector space.
Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors. Using this formula we can find out the similarity between any two documents d1 and d2. 
Dataset: The attached dataset is referred from the site (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/QA-data/) and in future the dataset might get updated based on the future requirements.
